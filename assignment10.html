    <div id="description">The API I selected describes historical, current, and 
        forecasted weather and air quality conditions in different locations 
        around the world.</div>
        
        <div id="website">https://www.iqair.com/air-pollution-data-api</div>
        
        <div id="options">I created a new XMLHttpRequest in order to be able to 
        send and receive data from a web server. From there i used open() to 
        create a request to access the data from the given web server. Then 
        using send(), I sent a request to the web server to access the data 
        from the API. I then had to ensure that the request had been completed
        successfully before I attempted to access the data.</div>
        
        <div id="apps">One application where this API would be helpful would be for 
            areas affected by wildfires or high air pollution so people know the 
            air quality index and can see if it is safe for them to go outside. 
            Also this API provides the current weather conditions so this would also 
            be helpful on a hotel's website so tourists know the historical, 
            current, and forecasted temperatures when planning a trip.</div>
